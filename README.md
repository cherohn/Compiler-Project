# 🛠️ Compiler Project – Java Lexical, Syntactic & Semantic Analysis

This project implements key compiler components from *scratch* in Java, focusing on **lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis**.

It was developed as part of a Computer Science evaluation, showcasing practical understanding of core concepts in compiler construction.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Modern compilers are composed of multiple phases that transform high-level code into a structured representation that can be further compiled or interpreted.

This project includes:

- 🔍 **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)** – Tokenizes source input
- 📐 **Syntactic Analysis (Parser)** – Builds structure based on grammar
- 🧠 **Semantic Analysis** – Validates meaning and rules of the language

Each component is built manually without external parser generators, aiming to reinforce conceptual understanding of how compilers work internally.

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This implementation showcases:

- Core compiler design fundamentals
- Token classification and processing
- Grammar parsing techniques
- Context validation rules (semantic checks)
- Java programming with modular architecture
- Understanding of language translation stages

These skills overlap with areas such as formal languages, automata, and language processing. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

📘 Background: Compiler Phases

A compiler typically operates in multiple stages:

Lexical Analysis – Dissects raw text into tokens

Syntactic Analysis – Interprets token sequence according to grammar

Semantic Analysis – Applies language rules for correctness

These stages form the backbone of most language processors.

---

📌 Purpose

This project was created to practice and demonstrate competence in:

✔ Compiler construction fundamentals
✔ Language parsing from the ground up
✔ Java implementation without parser generators
✔ Separation of concerns in software design

It represents hands-on experience with deep computer science concepts beyond typical application development.
